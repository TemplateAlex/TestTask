This project was created on Razor Pages technology (alternative of MVC). Version of .NET - 5.0 (EF Core Tools, and EF Core SqlServer - 5.0.17)
Also I installed Runtime Compilation for Razor (v. 5.0.9).
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (v. 6.3.1)
From DBMS, MSSQL was used here(I used localDB, therefore I saved migrations of my tables, also my DB has the name - Company.)
You can check link between RazorPages and DB in the Startup.cs file, exactly in method ConfigureServices.
